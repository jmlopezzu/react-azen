Certainly, you can use Next.js for your frontend application along with Socket.io for real-time communication. Below is a basic guide on how to set up a simple Next.js app with Socket.io for real-time functionality.

### 1. Set Up the Backend (Node.js with Socket.io)

#### Install Necessary Packages
Navigate to your project's root directory and create a `backend` folder.

```bash
mkdir backend
cd backend
npm init -y
npm install express socket.io
```

Create a `server.js` file inside the `backend` folder:

```javascript
// backend/server.js
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const socketIO = require('socket.io');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIO(server);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('A user connected');

  // Handle events from clients
  socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
    io.emit('chat message', msg);
  });

  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('User disconnected');
  });
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Run the backend server:

```bash
node backend/server.js
```

### 2. Set Up the Frontend (Next.js)

#### Create a Next.js App
Open a new terminal window, navigate to your project's root directory, and create a Next.js app:

```bash
npx create-next-app frontend
cd frontend
```

#### Install Socket.io Client
Install the `socket.io-client` package to enable communication between the frontend and backend:

```bash
npm install socket.io-client
```

#### Create a Simple Next.js App
Edit the `pages/index.js` file to create a simple Next.js app with socket communication:

```javascript
// frontend/pages/index.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://localhost:5000'); // Replace with your backend server URL

export default function Home() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
      setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, msg]);
    });

    return () => {
      socket.disconnect();
    };
  }, []);

  const sendMessage = () => {
    socket.emit('chat message', message);
    setMessage('');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {messages.map((msg, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{msg}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={message}
        onChange={(e) => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={sendMessage}>Send</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Run the Frontend
Start your Next.js app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now you have a basic Next.js app communicating with the Node.js backend using Socket.io. As before, you can expand and enhance this setup based on your specific requirements. If you have more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

Yes, you've got it right! Next.js is a framework built on top of React that simplifies the process of building React applications by providing additional features and conventions. In the setup I provided:

1. **Backend (Node.js with Socket.io):**
   - The backend server is implemented using Node.js.
   - Socket.io is used for real-time communication between the server and clients.

2. **Frontend (Next.js):**
   - The frontend application is built using Next.js, which is based on React.
   - The `socket.io-client` library is used on the frontend to establish a connection with the Socket.io server.

So, you have a separation between the backend (handling server logic, including real-time communication) and the frontend (built with Next.js and React, interacting with the backend via sockets). This separation is common in modern web development to create scalable and maintainable applications.

Feel free to ask if you have more questions or if there's anything specific you'd like to know or implement!
